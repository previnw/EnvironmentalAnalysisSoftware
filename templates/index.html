			<h5>Project Goal:</h5>
			<p>The goal of our project is to create a module that will help ensure air quality for our consumers based on their needs. Whether it be keeping everyone safe in a factory setting or making sure that the humidity and temperature of a wine cellar is in the perfect range, we want to make sure that anyone can keep track of their environment accurately.</p>
			<h5>Short Project Description:</h5>
			<p>Description of the module and the webpage schematics and what we used for each part (I2C, SPI, etc...)</p>
